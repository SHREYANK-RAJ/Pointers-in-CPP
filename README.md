# Pointer Examples in C++

This folder contains simple C++ programs to understand **memory addresses** and **pointers**.

## Files
- **check_address.cpp** → Prints a variable's value and its memory address.
- **pointer.cpp** → Demonstrates pointer basics: initialization, dereferencing, copying pointers, pointer arithmetic, and modifying values through pointers.
- **pointer_array.cpp → How arrays and pointers are secretly best friends. Also: pointer arithmetic.
- **pointer_char_array.cpp → Why printing a char* doesn’t behave like printing an int*.
- **pointer_functions.cpp → How to pass pointers into functions, and how arrays act when passed to functions.
